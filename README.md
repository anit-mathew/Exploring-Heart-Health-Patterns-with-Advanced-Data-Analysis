Introduction:
In an era where data is transforming industries, healthcare is no exception. Leveraging historical ride data, a ride-sharing company sought to optimize its pricing strategy. Similarly, a dataset filled with features related to heart health opens the door to developing predictive models for dynamic pricing. In this article, we delve into the exploration of heart health data, utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and xgboost models.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of various features such as resting blood pressure, chest pain type, thalassemia presence, age, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, gender, ST slope, cholesterol levels, ST depression, resting electrocardiographic results, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and the diagnosis (0 for no heart attack, 1 for a heart attack).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We initiated our exploration by conducting logistic regression, random forest, and xgboost analyses. Each model offered unique insights into feature importance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

Random Forest Insights:
The Random Forest model highlighted key features influencing heart health:

Thalassemia: 0.1347
Chest Pain: 0.1221
Exercise-Induced Angina: 0.1135
Maximum Heart Rate: 0.1129
Number of Vessels: 0.1058
ST Depression: 0.1016
Age: 0.0798
Cholesterol: 0.0702
Resting Blood Pressure: 0.0610
ST Slope: 0.0419
Gender: 0.0276
Resting ECG: 0.0204
Fasting Blood Sugar: 0.0084
The classification report indicated an overall accuracy of 70%, with precision, recall, and f1-score for both classes (0 and 1).

XGBoost Findings:
XGBoost, another powerful model, emphasized the significance of certain features:

Age: 103.0
Maximum Heart Rate: 100.0
Resting Blood Pressure: 60.0
Cholesterol: 56.0
ST Depression: 44.0
Number of Vessels: 43.0
Chest Pain: 41.0
Thalassemia: 37.0
Resting ECG: 34.0
Gender: 33.0
ST Slope: 30.0
Exercise-Induced Angina: 24.0
Fasting Blood Sugar: 7.0
XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 70% with a classification report revealing precision, recall, and f1-score for both classes.

Conclusion:
Our journey through heart health data using advanced analytics techniques revealed nuanced insights. Thalassemia, chest pain, exercise-induced angina, and maximum heart rate emerged as influential factors. These findings not only contribute to understanding heart health but also showcase the power of data-driven approaches in healthcare analytics. As we embrace the era of data, these methodologies can pave the way for more accurate diagnostics and personalized treatments in the future.
